# NumPy is a multi-dimensional array object, similar to a list.
# NumPy is much faster than Python lists.

# Int32 holds 4 bytes, or 32 bits. 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
# Int8 holds 1 byte, or 8 bits. 00000000

# Python list hold Size, Reference, Value, Object Type. While Numpy only hold values.
# Python list is mutable, while Numpy is not? Fact check this is it from github copilot.

# Numpy is contiguous (all values in one place). Python list is not.
# a Python list is a bunch of pointers to where the data is stored.

# Numpy can to additions deletions etc as can Python lists, but Numpy can do much more.
# Mathlab Pandas and Scipy are other packages that use Numpy? double check this.
