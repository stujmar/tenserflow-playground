# What is deep learning?
# Multiple layers of processing to extract information from data.
# Machine learning is data into numbers and pulling out patterns.

# (AI(ML(NN))) (AI(ML(DL))) Neural Nets, Deep Learning, within Machine Learning.
# Provide Data and Outcome and ML/DL will provide the rules/path to get there.

# Example with a self driving car all the rules would be too much to type.
# If you can build a simple rule based system don't use ML.
