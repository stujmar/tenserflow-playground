# What is deep learning?
# Multiple layers of processing to extract information from data.
# Machine learning is data into numbers and pulling out patterns.

# (AI(ML(NN))) (AI(ML(DL))) Neural Nets, Deep Learning, within Machine Learning.
# Provide Data and Outcome and ML/DL will provide the rules/path to get there.

# Example with a self driving car all the rules would be too much to type.
# If you can build a simple rule based system don't use ML.
# Google's ML guide https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides

# Lots of data and room for error, then ML is good for you.

# ML likes structured data. Columns = Features.

# DL works well on unstructured data, loose text, video, audio.
